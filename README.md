# LightTBNet-Pakistan

This is a modified version of **LightTBNet** by Dani Capellán — adapted for a local Pakistani dataset, with extra preprocessing utilities and a Streamlit visualization app.

## ⚙️ Overview

Original project: [LightTBNet by dani‑capellan](https://github.com/dani-capellan/LightTBNet)  

Modifications include:

- Adjusted hyperparameters (number of epochs, batch size, image dimensions) to run on a VM/laptop environment.  
- Used a local Pakistani dataset.  
- Added preprocessing scripts to convert raw images into CSV and PKL files for training.  
- Built a Streamlit app to visualize results easily.  
- (Optional) Included a results folder showing training outputs and evaluation plots.

## 🏋️ Training

1. Configure hyperparameters in `config_train.yaml` (default values provided; adjust as needed).  
2. Run the training script:

```bash
python train.py
```

3. By default, model checkpoints and outputs are saved in the `results/` folder.

## 🧪 Testing

1. Configure testing parameters in `config_test.yaml`.  
2. Run the test script:

```bash
python test.py
```

3. Test results are saved in the `results_test/` folder.

## 💡 Tips & Considerations

- Preprocessing applies CLAHE by default. Disable by setting `clahe -> enabled` in the config file.  
- To select a specific GPU:

```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python train.py
```

- Ensure your dataset CSV/PKL files follow the format generated by the preprocessing scripts.  
- Streamlit app:

```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app/app.py
```

Use this app to visualize predictions and results interactively.
